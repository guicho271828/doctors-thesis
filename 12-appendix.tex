 Coverage comparison (the number of instances solved in 5min, 4GB, LMcut

 the standard baseline tie-breaking algorithms. We highlight the
 best results when the difference between the maximum and the minimum coverage exceeds 2.

\subsection{\mands Data for \reftbl{tbl:lmcut-zerocost-std}}

\begin{table}[htbp]

 \caption{
 Coverage comparison (the number of instances solved) 
 between the original IPC instances and the modified Zerocost instances,
 using the same configuration and experimental setting (5min, 4GB, \mands heuristics).
 This table does not include domains where the total number of instances
 differ in the Zerocost domain and the original IPC domain. The results in
 those domains are available in the later sections.
