\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

In this paper, we investigated the tiebreaking strategies for cost-optimal search using \astar.  Our design goals
were (1) to shed some light on the importance of the tiebreaking in one of the most popular best-first search
algorithms, (2) to improve \astar without modifying its main heuristic function at all, and (3) to
improve \astar by introducing inadmissible techniques. We reached all of these goals successfully: We sought
various possible enhancements and achieved significant performance improvements solely by the tiebreaking
techniques. In detail, the contributions in this paper are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item We showed that tiebreaking has a significant role in the cost-optimal
       search using \astar. We empirically showed that most instances in the IPC
       benchmark have large plateaus with regard to $f$, and most of the
       search effort is spent in the final plateau with $f=f^*$.
 \item A common tiebreaking rule using $h$ value was shown to fail to
       provide guidance in the plateau when the instances have zero-cost
       actions and have large plateaus with regard to $h$.
       We empirically showed that most of the search effort can be spent in
       the final plateau with $f=f^*, h=0$ in some domains. We pointed out that in such
       a plateau, the search is controlled solely by the
       default tiebreaking \fifo, \lifo or \ro.
 \item We proposed and analyzed a new set of benchmark instances for cost-optimal planning, called Zerocost domains.
       They tend to have larger final plateaus with $f=f^*, h=0$ and pose a new challenge to the traditional search
       algorithms.
 \item As one solution to Zerocost domains, we proposed a depth metric
       which measures the distance from the entrance to the
       plateau. Using this metric, we described the pathological
       behaviors of \fifo, \lifo and \ro, proposed a new diversification
       strategy, theoretically and empirically showed that it avoids the
       pathological behavior and achieves a better performance.
 \item As another solution to Zerocost domains, we proposed the use of
       inadmissible heuristics as part of multi-heuristics tiebreaking.
       Depth metric further improves the performance of those
       heuristics. Although there is an additional cost to compute
       multiple heuristic values, the cost can be eliminated by a simple
       case-based configuration which checks for zero-cost actions.
 \item We introduced a new view to cost-optimal \astar search: Optimizing search can be seen as a series of satisficing
       search in the plateaus of an increasing order of $f$. This view introduces more opportunity to using the
       satisficing techniques for cost-optimal search.
\end{enumerate}

Future work implements the last view by introducing much more variety of
existing satisficing search techniques to cost-optimal search.

% Another direction for future work is implementing tiebreaking strategies for IDA* and similar linear-space
% strategies like RBFS.
% For example, how do we implement or simulate depth-based tiebreaking with a linear space usage?
% \todo*{In fact, exploring the application of ``IDA* = series of satisficing seraches'' seems like an interesting
% direction for future work, e.g., how to simulate depth-based tiebreaking (node ordering) in IDA*? IDA* is useful
% for domains where memory limitations are the bottleneck, so keeping the depth buckets in memory may not be
% possible. More broadly, linear space, best-first search including RBFS}
