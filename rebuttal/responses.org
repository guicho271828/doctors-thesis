First, thanks very much to all of the reviewers for their detailed and helpful comments.
We examined those comments seriously and significantly improved the quality of the paper
in ways that are addressed below.

We reduced the number of tables but we also added a few tables, Algorithm sections, proofs in
order to address the concern by the reviewers.
As a result, the numbering of the tables/figures are changed from the orignal manuscript.
In this response, we use [Renumbered:X] to indicate that we refer to those figures using
the new numbering system, and [Original:X] to indicate the numbers in the original manuscript.
