First, thanks very much to all of the reviewers for their detailed and helpful comments.
To address the reviewers' comments, we have modified the paper as described below.
# removed because this could be interpreted as a significantly new material/expaerimental resutls
# significantly

To reduce the length of the main portion of thepaper, we moved many tables to the Appendix, 
eliminated some tables and consolidated some figures. We also added a few figures, Algorithms,
# ??
proofs in order to address the concern by the reviewers.
As a result, the numbering of the tables/figures are changed from the orignal manuscript.
In this response, we use [Renumbered:X] to indicate that we refer to those figures using
the new numbering system, and [Original:X] to indicate the numbers in the original manuscript.

* Reviewer 1

** 1) The definition of plateau can be improved.

# [Don't abbreviate the reviewer's comment, as that forces the editor to open the review file and go
# back-and-forth betwen the response and the review files.  Minimize the editor's work by quoting the entire,
# relevant comment to which we're replying]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The definition of plateau can be improved. The formal definition of
a plateau should include a plateau with respect to some cost
functions. So, you have a plateau with respect to f, plateau(f), a
plateau with respect both g and h, plateau(g,h) etc. This should be
defined at the beginning and this terminology should be later used all
over. Currently, you are not fully formal and consistent on this. As
you say on page 18. a plateau is related to a sorting strategy. Define
this in the beginning. In fact you write the following sentence which
is in fact a definition: "Having the same key values means that n and
m are on the same plateau". Move this to be a definition in one of the
first sections."
#+END_QUOTE

Plateaus are formally defined in the 2nd-to-last paragraph of Section 2, Preliminaries.
However, as the reviewer noted, there were some informal usages of the term plateau througout the paper.
In the revision, we increased the usage of the more precise notation "plateau(f,h)" throughout the paper.

** 2) page 18: "In order to diversify the expansion... " --> This paragraph is very hard to understand

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
2) page 18: "In order to diversify the expansion... " --> This
paragraph is very hard to understand but it is a very important
paragraph as it gives the pseudo code for your new technique. Please
rewrite it. What is Dc? Is this a counter? Is there one Dc or one for
each depth? Please clarify. Maybe even give an example.

page 20: "round-robin sampling from the available depth buckets as
described above." --> This is a key sentence that might help
understanding what exactly is the diversifying method. I think you
mean you that do a round robin from the deepest available depth to the
shallowest available depth. You must clarify this.
#+END_QUOTE

We rewrote the description and added a with a pseudo code in Section 6.
d_c is a counter assigned to each plateau.

** 3) It will be very interesting to see what happens if you factor away the constant time per node.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
page 22: Table 7.5. It will be very interesting to see what
happens if you factor away the constant time per node. Just compare
the number of nodes expanded for a set of instances that can be solved
by all methods (as you did in the 4.1-4.5 tables). This will tell you
if indeed this is the reason for the negative behavior. This is a
rather major comment. You do not always have to use the 30 minutes
limit in your experiments.
#+END_QUOTE

In order to factor away the constant low-level overhead of depth bucket
which is degrading the performance of M&S in IPC domains,
we compared the number of node evaluations between the depth-diversified and standard search method.
We newly added Figure [Renumbered:7.2] comparing the cumulative coverage over the number of evaluations.
We limited the instances to those successfully solved by both.
The result shows that the evaluations are almost identical for most IPC instances.
There were differences in Openstacks, as expected.

** TODO 4) Section 5: Zerocost domains. I buy all your arguments on zero cost :5.3: :section:5.3:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Section 5: Zerocost domains. I buy all your arguments on zero cost
domains. You spend too much effort to validate them. I suggest to
shorten this entire section and the related tables. All your claims
seem reasonable and you do not have to necessarily show all the
numbers. The claims about FIFO in infinite graphs (section 5.3) is
trivial. You can shorten it or even delete it.
#+END_QUOTE

We moved one of the table to appendix. We also shortened the section.

** TODO 5) Section 6.1 is trivial.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Section 6.1 is trivial. It is easy to see that different "depth"
values only occur in zero domains. I would shorten it or even omit it.
#+END_QUOTE

** TODO 6) Section 7.1: this section repeats what you said above and ...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Section 7.1: this section repeats what you said above and I was
convinced when you said it. You can just report that you observed this
in your experiments and I do not need to see all the exact results.
Consider to omit these experiments and just mention that you have
results that support this trend.
#+END_QUOTE

We shortened and moved the discussion to appendix.

** 7) The beginning of Section 8 is also rather trivial.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The beginning of Section 8 is also rather trivial. This is the main
rational behind IDA* as you say in the end. I would significantly
shorten it but it should get a subsection index if it stays. It is not
an introduction to your later section 8.1 which I find quite
interesting and more deep and should certainly be kept.
#+END_QUOTE

We shortened the beginning of Section 8.

We all changed the points being suggested. Thank you very much.

to the current node." -- should be "current shortest known path"

syntax. Give the reference and then give your comment but not in the
same parenthesis.

Fixed as you suggested.

** minor 3) -- Calling it the  third is misleading...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
page 21: "the third, depth-diversification criteria." Calling it the
third is misleading. It is actually the second which comes before the
default criterion.
#+END_QUOTE

Fixed as you suggested.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The first sections are very short. Maybe they can be one large section
with different subsections.
#+END_QUOTE

We merged the section 3 into section 2.

** TODO minor 5) -- Indeed distance-to-go is a term that was used by other... :noexport:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Section 9. Indeed distance-to-go is a term that was used by other and
coined Ruml et al. which should be cited and credited for that. But I
think the correct term should be something like
"number-of-hops-to-go". Distance is ambiguous.
#+END_QUOTE

?? Fixed as you suggested.

* Reviewer 2

** 1) Maxim Likhachev's ARA* paper...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Maxim Likhachev's ARA* paper [1] presents an elegant solution to
avoid the final plateau problem for non zero-cost domains. His
algorithm notes the cost of the goal, whenever a new path to goal is
discovered, and concludes the search when the minimum cost of any
state in OPEN becomes greater than or equal to the current goal cost
(f = f*). While this approach is not applicable for 0-cost domains, I
think this merits a discussion and probable inclusion of results in
case of other domains used.
#+END_QUOTE

We added a paragraph describing the relationship to ARA* in Related Work.

ARA* could largely avoid the problem of final plateau if the previous suboptimal searches happen to
have found the optimal solution already (and thus pruning most nodes on f=f*). However, this applies only to the iterated, real-time
search algorithms.

** 2) the amount of data is a bit too much...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 While I appreciate the in-depth experimental investigation
presented in this work, i think the amount of data is a bit too much.
For example, 26 plots for number of nodes vs depth is rather
confusing. I like the summarization done for most tables, which points
to the key take-aways. I think the experimental results should be
presented in a more compact fashion, and if needed the detailed
results can be pushed to an appendix (even there, i believe some
compaction will be good). This will also help to reduce the length of
the paper. Currently, it seems too long for the content.
#+END_QUOTE

We moved some tables to appendix.

** TODO 3) the theory and analysis part... Section 5.3

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 While the paper presents experimental results in detail, the theory
and analysis part looks weak in my opinion. Most of the analytical
results are presented in an informal manner. For example, 5.3
discusses the completeness of search strategies on ZeroCost domains. I
would suggest that such results should be presented using formal
statements with proofs.
#+END_QUOTE

we are in conflict 

** TODO 3) the theory and analysis part... Section 6.1

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Similarly, the analysis in 6.1 can be more
precise, results in 6.1 can be presented in terms of theorems.
#+END_QUOTE

** 4) Sec6, "more nodes will tend to have shallower depth" vs disjoint forest model

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 In the last paragraph of section 6, it is stated that "more nodes
will tend to have shallower depth than deeper depth" whereas the
analysis in 6.3 assumes a disjoint forest model which i guess
increases the number of nodes with depth. These two assumptions seems
to be in contrast to each other. I think a more formal treatment of
the analysis can allay such confusions for a reader.
#+END_QUOTE

We clarify this here as well as in the paper.
We also added some figures for better understanding.

The /no-exhaustion assumption/ assumes that no depth bucket exhausts due to the expansion.
This implies that there are sufficiently large number of nodes in depth $d=0$ so that
 depth 0 does not exhaust as a result of expansion.
If FIFO default tiebreaking is used,
it tries to expand all those nodes in depth 0 before expanding any nodes in depth d >= 1.
Similar situation happens at every depth.
Thus, even if the entire graph is a forest model, FIFO causes a heavy bias to the shallow depth.

Indeed, if all nodes in the entire graph are expanded, there are surely more nodes in larger depth.
However, the nodes expanded during the search process are biased to the shallower region.

In practice,
the nodes in depth 0 are the nodes that were generated as a result of expanding earlier plateaus,
i.e. the entire set of frontier nodes whose number is sufficiently large for FIFO
to cause pathological behavior.

** 5) I think it will be helpful if the authors include pseudocodes for...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 All the strategies proposed are explained in text only. I think it
will be helpful if the authors include pseudocodes for their
algorithms. In fact, i think it will be helpful if the authors present
a basic A* algorithm with default tie-breaking and build upon that for
their strategies. It will create a nice flow in my opinion, and use of
pseudocode will also remove any chance of mis-interpreting the
strategies.
#+END_QUOTE

Added pseudo code for Best-First search, Depth diversification and A*-as-sequence-of-SAT-search,
as you suggested.

** TODO 6) state/prove the properties of each of these algorithms, especially important ones like completeness

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Tied to point 6, i think it would be good to state/prove the
properties of each of these algorithms/strategies, especially
important ones like completeness. The current format leaves a lot of
un-answered questions like does depth-diversification ensure
completeness (for infinite spaces). The answers may be obvious in many
cases, however, i would still prefer if they are explicitly
stated/proved.
#+END_QUOTE

** 7) I like the idea of representing A* as a series of satisficing search. Here also, i would suggest inclusion of pseudocode.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 I like the idea of representing A* as a series of satisficing
search. Here also, i would suggest inclusion of pseudocode. For
example, A* exhausts an f-plateau before moving on to the next one.
While this is expressed in text, highlighting such properties through
pseudocode may improve a reader's understanding. Similar to earlier
cases, here also the authors can start with a basic pseudocode (for A*
as a series of satisficing searches), and present their strategies on
top of that with formal discussion about the properties.
#+END_QUOTE

Added pseudo code for Best-First search, Depth diversification and A*-as-sequence-of-SAT-search,
as you suggested.

** TODO 8) I think it will be interesting to find out what is distribution of goal depth in the final frontier

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 I think it will be interesting to find out what is distribution of
goal depth in the final frontier. I believe there will be a strong
correlation between the goal depth and the relative performance of the
strategies (which the authors mention), and it would be good to
analyze this statistically. Similarly, for strategies in section 9, it
would be interesting to find out the correlation between the
performance of different strategies with the accuracy of the
distance-to-go estimates.
#+END_QUOTE

** TODO 9) Finally, I think it would be nice if we have some infinite spaces in the ZeroCost domains

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Finally, I think it would be nice if we have some infinite spaces
in the ZeroCost domains, and understand the impact of different
strategies on them. My hunch is that in many cases people use
fifo/breadth-first exploration to avoid completeness problems, i
believe inclusion of such graphs (or some domains that closely
approximate such behavior) will enhance the analysis.
#+END_QUOTE

** minor comments

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 I think the abstract needs to be re-written to precisely state the
contribution. In particular i would suggest changing the sentences
after "With this in mind, ..". Somehow it seems that the depth
diversification is the second strategy, which is not the case. Also,
"We proposes" -> "We propose".
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 page 27, claim 1 "A Last-In-First-Out ..". Is this a general claim,
or is it tied to the domains you tested on. I think this should be
made clear.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Section 2, the 4th paragraph can probably be combined with the
second. Also, may be it would be better if you present exact formal
definitions of the terms.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 I would suggest that you include some pictorial representation of
your analysis in section 6.3. There are several illustrations of A*
layers in other places that are helpful, some such illustration of
your model would be nice.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 There are a number of typos and grammar mistakes, please correct
them. For example, "did not modified" -> "did not modify", "new
current parent" -> "current parent", and others.
#+END_QUOTE

Thank you for the detailed comments, they are all fixed according to your suggestions.

* Reviewer 3

** 1) There are a large number of colourful scatterplots in the paper, most of which would probably be better presented in a different form.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 There are a large number of colourful scatterplots in the paper, most
of which would probably be better presented in a different form. For
example, the data in Figure 1.1 is essentially 1-dimensional: what we
are interested in is the distribution or frequency of ratios between
the size of the final plateau and the search space; a histogram or a
cumulative distribution would show this more clearly. Whether colour-
coding it for domains is useful is questionable; there's only a few
points that can be distinguished well enough to identify what domain
they belong to (and even those do not tell the full story, since there
is no way to see where other instances from the same domain fall).

The data in Figures in 4.1, 4.2, 5.2 and 7.1 would similarly benefit
from a more thought-through visual presentation.
#+END_QUOTE

The figure [Original,Renumbered:4.1] and [Original,Renumbered:4.2] should be in the present form.
The role of these figures is to identify which domain is affected by the different default criteria.

The figure [Original,Renumbered:1.1] is paired with [Original,Renumbered:4.2].
If we change the format of [Original,Renumbered:1.1] from the current one to the histogram,
then it loses the consistency with [Original,Renumbered:4.2].

Separating the figure into per-domain analyses would further increase the paper length.

However, we indeed benefit from converting [Original,Renumbered:7.1] into a histograms
comparing the node evaluation ratio, because the domain charactersitics is not important
in this figure. Thank you for the suggestion.

** TODO 2) The description in the early part of the paper (Sections 1, 3, 4, 5) somewhat convey the false impression that there has been no previous recognition of the challenge that plateaus can create for A* search

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The description in the early part of the paper (Sections 1, 3, 4, 5)
somewhat convey the false impression that there has been no previous
recognition of the challenge that plateaus can create for A* search,
in particular in the presence of zero cost transitions, or attempts to
address it. There are a number of relevant related works, for example,
those by Benton et al., and Cushing et al., which are cited somewhere
in the paper, but do not appear anywhere in the initial discussion nor
in the related works section. (The SoCS 2011 paper "Cost-Based
Heuristic Search Is Sensitive to the Ratio of Operator Costs", by
Christopher Wilt and Wheeler Ruml, may also be relevant.) This should
be rectified; the previous state of knowledge should be clearly
established early in the paper.
#+END_QUOTE

Fixed as you suggested.

** TODO 3) This applies also to the summary of the authors earlier conference paper.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 This applies also to the summary of the authors earlier conference
paper. Rather than the "note" at the end of the introduction (which I
assume the authors intend to remove from the published version of the
paper), the summary of that paper, and the novel contributions this
article makes over it, should be integrated in the presentation.
#+END_QUOTE

Fixed as you suggested.


** 4) The argument in the last paragraph before Section 5.1 and the second paragraph of Section 5.1 do not make sense.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 The argument in the last paragraph before Section 5.1 and the second
paragraph of Section 5.1 do not make sense. First, the authors say
they selected subsets of instances of some domains in order to avoid
skewing the results by uneven instance set sizes; but then, these
domains are excluded from the following analysis.
#+END_QUOTE

The analyses from which these instances are excluded are Section 5.1 only.
Those domains are still evaluated in the later sections.

** 5) Furthermore in Section 5.1, why is the comparison done using the [f,h,fifo] strategy

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Furthermore in Section 5.1, why is the comparison done using the
[f,h,fifo] strategy, given that the experiment in Section 4 showed
tie-breaking using "lifo" to be much more efficient?
#+END_QUOTE

The aim of this experiment is to show that there can be some performance difference for some planner,
and we consider this is sufficient.
Being the planner Fast Downward, which is currently the most successful state-of-the-art planner
and by default uses the FIFO default tiebreaking,
we consider using FIFO as a representative would be a reasonable choise.

Also, you can extract the numbers for [f,h,lifo] experiments from
Table [Original:7.2, Renumbered:12.3] and Table [Original:7.4, Renumbered:12.5].
We obtained the same results using these numbers:
The coverages in the original and Zerocost domains are similarly different.

** 6) In Section 6.2, the authors argue that ... pruning methods ... are somehow equivalent to tie-breaking. This is not accurate.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 In Section 6.2, the authors argue that pruning methods such as
symmetry or partial order reduction are somehow equivalent to
tie-breaking. This is not accurate. Although a bias towards some
states may be created by the presence of, for example, symmetries, as
the authors argue, pruning the symmetric states does _more_ than just
"remove the bias". If the states in question have f-values that are
less than the cost of the optimal solution, no form of tie-breaking
will prevent A* from expanding all of them, but symmetry pruning will.
#+END_QUOTE

In the revised version, we clarified that pruning is a stonger technique
than diversification.

** 7) In Section 7, Table 7.1 shows that there is little consistency in the results

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 In Section 7, Table 7.1 shows that there is little consistency in the
results, particularly on the benchmark set in which only a few domains
have zero cost actions. Table 7.2 shows that this is the case even on
the Zerocost problem set, when considerd by domain. This is worth more
emphasis in the discussion. While the experiment shows that
depth-based tie-breaking *can* be advantageous, it is by no means
always the case.
#+END_QUOTE

The inconsistency is natural considering
that the aim of diversifying the depth is to choose the *safest* practice in a domain-independent
manner. Depending on the domain, the *best* practice may vary -- for example, fifo is the best in
airport-fuel with LMcut, while lifo is the best in freecell-move with LMcut.
However, although these two default strategies may work well in some domains,
it does more harm than good in many other domains,
encountering the worst case pathological behavior.

This is previously addressed in section 6 in the original version:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"In the former case, fifo should perform well because... However, in the latter case, exhaustively
searching the shallower depths can result in ... because ..."
#+END_QUOTE

In the revised version,
we added a paragraph in the end of section 7
emphasizing and explaining the inconsistency you suggested.

** 8) I'm somewhat sceptical about the value of these figures...which of the examples are showing the failure of depth-based tie-breaking strategies.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 I'm somewhat sceptical about the value of these figures. They show
only examples of what can happen on isolated instances. Although such
deep-dives may be useful to explain what is happening in different
cases (particularly given the variance in the results), the volume and
unclear selection of the examples make them less informative. (For
instance, it is not clear which of the examples are showing the
failure of depth-based tie-breaking compared to default tie-breaking
strategies.)
#+END_QUOTE

The purpose of these figures is not to show the performance,
but how depth diversification and other strategies follow the expected depth distribution.
(Sec.7.1, "To understand the behavior of depth-based policies...")

In terms of performance measured by the number of expanded nodes,
freecell-move p04 in Figure [original:7.2, renumbered:7.3], mid-right,
is an instance on which lifo solved the problem
with much smaller expansions than depth diversification.
This can also be seen as the coverage difference in Table [original:7.2, renumbered:12.2].
