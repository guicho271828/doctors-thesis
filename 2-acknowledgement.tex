\chapter{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank my supervisor Alex Fukunaga for accepting me as a
student in the first place, despite being a lone-wolf without a regular CS
background. Without him, I would have struggled to find a reasonable
path in this career, writing good papers and doing good research.
He also advised me a lot as a hacker and a great Sempai of life.
My sporadic distraction of attention would have completely failed me
if he hadn't keep me on track.

I would also like to thank the people in shibuya.lisp for keeping my
mindset as a hacker and for some chances to have a research outreach by
a casual talk. Similar to the enthusiastic and insightful people ICAPS community,
who all love planning and share the common goal toward intelligence.

This research was supported by a JSPS Grant-in-Aid for JSPS
Fellows. Their research budget was, however, too low for my research
output, and I had to cover some expenses myself even with some
scholarship from the conferences.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for the patient support,
despite several accidents I was involved in during cycling, or failures
at the foreign airport, or this or that...  I have been and always will
be your troublesome kid.  It is unlikely that I fix my problems I born
with, but I will leverage my troublesomeness to disrupt the world.
