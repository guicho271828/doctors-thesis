Previous work on escaping search space plateaus has focused on
non-admissible search.  DBFS \cite{imai2011novel} % is a technique which
adds stochastic backtracking to Greedy Best First Search (GBFS) to avoid
being misdirected by the heuristic function. Type based bucket
\cite{xie14type} classifies the plateau of GBFS according to the
$[g,h]$ pair and distributes the effort.  Marvin \cite{Coles07} learns plateau-escaping macros
from the Enhanced Hill Climbing phase of the FF planner
\cite{Hoffmann01}, and the use of these macros is inadmissible.
\citeauthor{Hoffmann05} gives a detailed analysis of the
structure of the search spaces of satisficing planning (\citeyear{Hoffmann05,Hoffmann11}).
\cite{benton2010g} proposes inadmissible technique for temporal planning
where short actions 
% are hidden behind long actions and
do not increase makespan. 
\cite{cushing2010cost} investigates ``$\varepsilon$-cost
traps''($\varepsilon=\frac{\min cost}{\max cost}$),  showing that (non-admissibly) treating all actions as unit cost sometimes finds an optimal plan quickly.
\cite{wilt2011cost} also analyzes inadmissible distance-to-go estimates.
% 
To our knowledge, 
plateaus have not been previously investigated for cost-optimal planning with admissible search.
Admissible and inadmissible search differ significantly in how non-final plateaus (plateaus with $f < f^*$) are treated:
Inadmissible search can skip or escape plateaus whenever possible, while
admissible search cannot, unless it
is the final plateau ($f=f^*$, $h=0$) and a solution is found. %it directly finds a solution.

%In their work on combining multiple heuristics in a planner, 
% \citeauthor{RogerH10} (\citeyear{RogerH10}) considered a tiebreaking approach which works as follows:
% When combining two heuristics, one of the
% heuristics is used as the primary criterion, % for guiding the search,
% and the second heuristic is used to break ties among nodes with the same primary
% heuristic value.
% While this did not perform well in their work on satisficing planning, 
% additional criterion using a secondary heuristic
% for cost-optimal search is an interesting direction for future work.


The PLUSONE %\footnote{This term is used on the Fast Downward website.} XXfootnote takes too much space
cost-type (or distance-to-go) is a non-admissible search technique in the Fast Downward/LAMA planner
\cite{richter2010lama} which increases all action costs by 1.
% By eliminating zero-cost actions, this behaves similar to our $[f,h,\fd,\ro]$ tiebreaking.
%Using PLUSONE, three successive
%applications of zero-cost operators have cost 3, and two
%applications have cost 2, and smaller cost is preferred, just as
%\astar always expands the node with smaller $f$-value.
This technique explicitly targeted zero-cost actions,
and resulted in significantly better performance in the IPC-6
satisficing track \cite[p.137, Sec. 3.3.2]{richter2010lama}.
%\todo*{citation}
% There's a long discussion of Openstacks in \cite{richter2010lama}, p.167-169, but I can't find PLUSONE anywhere. Maybe it's called something else in the paper?  Maybe \richter2010lama is the wrong citation??
Unlike PLUSONE, depth-based tiebreaking is admissible.
%because unlike PLUSONE, action costs are not modified.  
Also, unlike PLUSONE, depth-based tiebreaking does not necessarily favor smaller depth over larger depth.
LAMA prefers smaller cost (including the increased cost),
which biases the search toward nodes with fewer zero-cost actions on their path.
This bias is similar to the $[f,h,\fd,\ro]$ strategy,
the worst performer among all depth-variants in our experiments (\reftbl{depth}).
The best depth-based methods are  $[f,h,\ld,\ro]$ and $[f,h,\rd,\ro]$,
which do not prefer smaller depth.

% It's not clear what these techniques have in common, except that they are all orthogonal to heuristics,
% If that's the case, then there's no need to cite them in this paper -- there's no reason why these particular techniques
% are more relevant to this paper than hundreds of other techniques that are orthogonal to heuristics.
%% In admissible planning,
%% \emph{Symmetry Breaking}
%% \cite{Fox1998,pochter2011exploiting,domshlak2013symmetry} is the search
%% technique that tries to prune the states with symmetric
%% paths. \emph{Partial Order Reduction}
%% % , \emph{Strong Stubborn Sets} and \emph{Expansion Core} are
%% is also a technique which prunes the
%% intermediate states that reach to the same goal using the different
%% orders of same actions. \emph{Dominance Pruning} \cite{hall2013faster} is a
%% technique which prunes a state if it can be proven to be worse than the other nodes.
%% % 
%% These are usually not considered an attempt to improve the heuristic
%% estimates, however, in terms of \emph{Path-dependent globally admissible
%% heuristics} \cite{karpas2012optimal}, a class of heuristics which is
%% admissible only on a particular optimal path, generalizes the above
%% techniques as assigning an infinite cost to some nodes on the other optimal paths.
%% % 
%% % From a slightly different category, Pathmax \cite{mero1984heuristic} and
%% % Bidirectional Pathmax \cite{felner2011inconsistent} are the techniques
%% % which converts an inconsistent heuristics into non-decreasing,
%% % consistent heuristics.
%% Thus, in a broad term, all of these methods are the
%% attempts to improve the heuristic estimates.
%% % Although in some particular
%% % case they may be able to return a perfect heuristics, they are still not
%% % always a perfect heuristics, implying that the plateau is unavoidable.
%% In contrast, our tiebreaking techniques aims specifically at the case
%% where the plateau is encountered and the planners are forced to run a
%% knowledge-free search.

\emph{\astar with lookahead} ($AL^*$) \cite{stern2010look} extends \astar by performing a cost-bounded depth-first \emph{lookahead} from each node as it is generated. Upon the normal expansion of a node $n$ in \astar, lookahead search performs a depth-first search with cost bound $f(n)+k$ rooted at $n$. As a special case, under the cost bound $k=0$ ($AL^*_0$ in their notation), depth-first lookahead expands only the children with the same $f$-value.
% There are both commonality and difference in our approach and $AL^*$:
% In terms of commonality, 
$AL^*$, or $AL^*_0$ in particular, is similar to $[f,\lifo]$ in that the lookahead is a depth-first search.
However, there are both conceptual and algorithmic difference in our approach and their approach:
First of all, $AL^*_0$ does not specify the intermediate tiebreaking (such as $h$-based tiebreaking) for its main \astar, and depth-first lookahead does not perform best-first expansion, so the tiebreaking is irrelevant. Thus, the problems and the solutions addressed in these approaches are different.
Second, $AL^*$ has an ability to propagate the maximum and the minimum $f$ value found in the lookahead search which allows for more pruning.
% wrong, see AAAI10 paper that ``recitify this''
% Finally, when $k>0$ the search becomes inadmissible because it alters the best-first expansion order.
