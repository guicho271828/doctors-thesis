\subsubsection{Search Behavior of IP-diversification}

We analyze the basic search behavior of IP-diversification by applying a blind search on IPC satisficing instances.
We ran four configurations, namely Type-based diversification with depth $d$ (hd:$[\depth]$) and IP-diversification (hb:$[\bip]$), as well as BreadthFS (h:$[\fifo]$) and random search (ro:$[\ro]$).
All solvers were given a 3 min/4GB resource limit.

We plotted the depth of the nodes expanded by these algorithms on two representative runs (\pddl{visitall-sat11-p20, tidybot-sat11-p08}) in \refig{fig:distribution}.
As expected, \ro behaves similarly to BreadthFS/\fifo (search is biased to the shallow depths) and
Depth-diversification shows a flat distribution because it is specifically designed to achieve the fair allocation among depths.
% avoid using ``effective branching factor'' without enough discussion
Compared to BreadthFS/\fifo and \ro, the increase of nodes-per-depth by IP-diversification is much slower, supporting our observation that IP is controlled by the least width in the search graph.
Compared to Type-based diversification which shows linear nodes-per-depth, IP still exhibits exponential behavior because IP has no explicit mechanism for balancing  the search  efforts wrto depths. However, IP expands smaller number of nodes in the shallower region.
Similar figures were obtained for other domains.

 %% because barman is ``flat'' in a sense it does not have peaks but also ``bumpy'' in a sense that it has lots of noise

We also compared their performance on IPC instances.
% in order to assess their pure effects not affected by any particular heuristics.
% We compared the performance of 
% (h) Standard GBFS,
% (hd) depth-based diversification $[h,\depth]$ and
% (hb) IP diversification $[h,\bip]$.
% Due to the characteristics of Blind heuristics which always returns a constant value 1, the only meaningful diversification is intra-plateau diversification.
\reftbl{tbl:blind} shows that both (hd) and (hb) improves upon blind BreadthFS while 
not strictly dominating each other: (hb) shows better performance than
(hd) on the \pddl{Tidybot} domain.
Comparison between \ro and hb indicate that the blind performance of IP is better than that of \ro in \pddl{tidybot} and \pddl{pegsol}.
% Thus, the base performance of (hd), (hb) and (ro) are shown to 
% These indicate that IP is a good candidate for improving the performance of heuristic search.
