\section{Intra- and Inter-Plateau Diversification on a State-of-the-Art Planner} % \sota kind of risky, but this time, I think we justfified usage of \sota  better by relating it to Jasper and Probe
% separating this out to once again remind readers of the intra-inter contribution

Up to this point, we have evaluated intra/inter-plateau exploration on greedy best-first search in order to cleanly isolate their effect.
Next, we evaluate the combined effect of intra/inter-plateau exploration when applied to a state-of-the-art planner,
% (\textbf{See Supplemental \reftbl{tbl:lama-supplemental} for configurations not listed in \reftbl{tbl:results}.})
% 
the LAMA2011 configuration in the current version of FastDownward,
which incorporates a number of search enhancement techniques such as lazy evaluation, multi-heuristic search and preferred operators.
In order to focus on coverage, we only run the first iteration (unit-cost GBFS) of LAMA, 
denoted as $alt([\ff],\pref{\ff},[\lc],\pref{\lc})$, where
% $\ff$ denotes the FF heuristics,
$\lc$ denotes the landmark-count heuristic
and $\pref{X}$ denotes the preferred operator queue with sorting strategy $X$.


% As additional baselines, we also include coverages for Probe \cite{LipovetzkyG11} and Jasper \cite{xie14ipc}, which are \sota, non-portfolio planners from the IPC'14 agile track, 
% Jasper combines Type-LAMA with GBFS-LS \cite{XieH14gbfsle}, which starts a local GBFS when 
% the number of expansion in the current local minima exceeds a certain threshold.
% %While this method address the problem of large plateau, it does not address the diversity
% %within plateau.
% %Also, since Jasper is based on an older LAMA, %
% We also include the original LAMA'11 implementation.
% %In our environment, Probe and Jasper did not outperform the original LAMA'11.
% %This is presumably due to the difference in the CPU speed (AMD@2.36GHz in IPC14 vs our Intel Haswell@2.9GHz), resulting in more search being performed in 5 minutes on our machines vs. the machines used in the IPC14 agile track competition.
% The latest FastDownward LAMA configuration performs better significantly better than the other baselines.


% Since our version is based on the latest FastDownward, we also tested the original version used in IPC2011.
% 
% Type-LAMA \cite{xie14type} 
% adds Type-based buckets $\brackets{g,h}$ to the list of alternating queues in LAMA, and is denoted as: 
% $alt\left([\ff],\ldots,\pref{\lc},\brackets{g,\ff}\right)$.

% We followed the best configuration suggested by \citeauthor{xie14type} (\citeyear{xie14type})
% for Type-GBFS, which uses the type vector $\brackets{g,\ff}$.

We apply the methods proposed in this paper incrementally.
We first add a single exploration strategy to LAMA.
(d, b) augments $[h]$ with type-based and IP diversification for intra-plateau exploration ($[h,\depth]$ and $[h,\bip]$), respectively.
(D, B) incorporates inter-plateau exploration by adding $\brackets{g,\ff}$ and $[\bip]$ to LAMA's alternation queue, respectively.
LAMA+D is equivalent to Type-LAMA \cite{xie14type}.
Next, we combine intra/inter-plateau diversification methods:
(dD) applies both changes in (d) and (D), and similarly (bB) applies both changes in (b) and (B).

Finally, (db$^2$DB) incorporates all 4 methods into LAMA.
Let $db$ denote $alt(\depth,\bip)$, alternation between depth and IP based diversification for intra-plateau exploration,
and let $DB$ denote $alt(\brackets{g,\ff},\bip)$, alternation between type-based and IP based diversification for inter-plateau exploration.
The resulting configuration,
LAMA-db$^2$DB, incorporates all of the ideas proposed in this paper: {\small $alt\big([\ff,db], \pref{\ff}, [\lc,db], \pref{\lc}, DB\big)$.}
This configuration alternates between type-based and IP diversification in each iteration.
It allocates 1/5 of the entire search time to inter-plateau exploration 
(same as the frequency with which Type-LAMA selects from $\brackets{g,\ff}$),
so it spends 1/10 of the time on $[\bip]$ and 1/10 of the time on $\brackets{g,\ff})$.
Adopting more sophisticated approaches for determining exploration frequency \cite{schulte2014balancing,nakhost2009monte} is a direction for future work.
%\citeauthor{schulte2014balancing} (\citeyear{schulte2014balancing}) combined Tree-search framework
%\cite{keller2013trial} with UCT \cite{kocsis2006bandit} to automatically adjust the ratio of exploration %in Classical Planning.
%Similarly, Arvand \cite{nakhost2009monte} uses Random Walk Local Search for exploration,
%with sophisticated mechanism for balancing the ratio. %Since our LAMA-Btdb uses a trivial approach for determining the exploration ratio (fixed to 1/5),
%Adopting these exploration-ration tuning approaches is a direction for future work.

% supplement?
%Since this experimental setting (satisficing, 5min limit) is similar to the Agile track of the IPC, 
% we also include results for Probe \cite{LipovetzkyG11}, which had the highest coverage in the 2014 IPC Agile track, as another baseline.


%% removed ``once every 5 expansions to be the same as TGBFS'' both because it was unclear what it meant, and also, it wasn't clear why it's desirable to match the Type-GBFS exploration rate.
%in order to explore at the same rate as Type-GBFS, we
%(once for every 5 expansions).

\reftbl{tbl:lama} shows the number of solved instances.
Each single diversification improved the overall performance of LAMA except LAMA+B.
For combinations of two methods (dD and bB),
complementary effects by intra-/inter-plateau diversification similar to \reftbl{tbl:results} are observed.
Although LAMA+B did not result in improvement, adding B to LAMA+b resulted in larger coverage in LAMA+bB.
Finally, bd$^2$BD outperformed all other methods.
We observed complementary effects from dD and bB, each addressing different diversity criteria.
% Type-based exploration sometimes significantly degrades LAMA performance when the heuristic is correct but ignored in favor of the type-based queue. 

%\section{Related Work} % let's remove the Related Work section because right now, the contents are 100% IP-related, and makes it look as though IP should be viewed as the most important contribution.

% Valenzano14 baseline discussion moved to IP section.

% too dangerous because there's no clear example of a "continuous space" which is clearly better suited for IP than novelty. replaced below in conclusions+future work with a more positive type of mention.
% % "novelty metric" itself needs to be mentioned, although we cant cite BWFS ...
% While novelty metric used in Probe \cite{LipovetzkyG11} or IW \cite{lipovetzky2012width} also addresses diversity of a new node from existing nodes, one drawback is that it assumes a propositional representation of the problem. As such, currently there is no straightforward way to compute the novelty metric on domains where no such representation is available. In contrast, IP-diversification only assumes the graph-based representation of the explored problem space and therefore, for example, the same method can be applied to the sampled nodes in a continuous space without modification, given the background theories on Percolation Physics on continuous space.
% The analysis in this direction is future work.

% \section{Related Work}
% 
% Other techniques that can be viewed as addressing breadth-biases are
% symmetry breaking \cite{Fox1998,pochter2011exploiting,domshlak2013symmetry}
% and partial order reduction \cite{hall2013faster,wehrle2013relative}.
% While these are usually described as ``pruning techniques'',
% they can be viewed as diversification techniques, in that 
% \emph{they aim to remove the bias for a set of redundant nodes.}
% % 
% Suppose we have a set of nodes $S=\{a_1, a_2, b, c\}$ where the subset
% $A=\{a_1, a_2\}$ is ``redundant'' according to some measure (e.g. by symmetry, partial order). 
% A search algorithm which selects a node randomly from $S$ for expansion is clearly biased -- 
% group $A$ is twice as likely to be expanded than either $b$ or $c$, although $a_1$ and $a_2$ are ``same'' nodes.
% By eliminating either $a_1$ or $a_2$, symmetry and partial-order reduction eliminates this bias.


% Seems safer to remove this, because Lelis et al 2013 is applied to sliding tiles, blocksworld, pancake, so claiming their work is for trees doesn't look right.
%% The previous work on Type system \cite{lelis2013stratified} has also used the number of children with particular
%% heuristic value. Although this could be another direction to address the breadth-related bias, our work is
%% significantly different --- First, we focus on the search on a general graph rather than a tree. Second, they claim
%% ``type system can use any information about a node to define its type'', without further explanation why this
%% metric works.
