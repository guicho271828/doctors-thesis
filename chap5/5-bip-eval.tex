% \subsubsection{Evaluation under Eager GBFS}

Given the performance of blind search,
IP-diversification is a good candidate for improving the performance of diversified heuristic search.
% In this section, we evaluate the effects of type-based diversification and IP-diversification on Eager GBFS, where nodes are evaluated as soon as they are generated.
% Since the effect of diversification could be heuristic-dependent, we tested $\ff$ and $\cg$.
% Following the previous work \cite{valenzano2014comparison,xie14type}, all configurations are evaluated under unit cost transformation
%  because we are solely focused on the coverage and the first solution.
% This is natural because GBFS has no guarantee on the plan cost.
% Also, according to \cite[p6, left, middle]{xie14type}, Type-GBFS does not incur significant loss in solution quality.
% 
% Finally, since depth diversification works only within plateaus, it does not change the best-first order wrto $h$
% value and it is unlikely to have significant change in solution quality except for some noise from the randomness
% in tiebreaking.

We compared the performance of 
(h), the standard GBFS, with
the combined Type-based diversification (hdD) from \refsec{sec:gbfs-comparison}
as well as intra-plateau  IP-diversification (hb:$[h,\bip]$), inter-plateau IP-diversification (hB:$alt([h],[\bip])$), and combined intra/inter-plateau IP diversification (hbB:$alt([h,\bip],[\bip])$).
% All configurations uses \fifo default tie-breaking which is the default configuration in Fast Downward,
% except Type-bucket in Type-GBFS (which uses \ro, as specified in their paper).
%(\textbf{See \reftbl{tbl:lazy-supplemental} in supplements for Lazy-GBFS results, where heuristic value of parents are used.})
% (\textbf{See Supplemental \reftbl{tbl:eager-supplemental} for comparisons to the other default tie-breaking methods (\lifo and \ro). \reftbl{tbl:lazy-supplemental} also contains Lazy-GBFS results, where heuristic value of parents are used}.)

% In order to remove the effect of randomness of the algorithm, we
% implemented a deterministic version of Type-based queue for Type-GBFS
% which, instead of selecting a bucket at random, iterates over the
% buckets in a reverse order that each bucket is introduced.
% Similarly, the diversification based on the depth is not randomized but
% is implemented as a loop-based implementation.

Results are shown in \reftbl{tbl:results2}. IP-diversification, applied to both
intra- and inter-plateau exploration, resulted in improvements on both the $\ff$ and $\cg$ heuristics.
Complementary effects similar to \reftbl{tbl:results} are observed between hb and hB, and  hbB outperforms both hb and hB.
This provides additional empirical evidence for the hypothesis that intra/inter-plateau exploration  are complementary, and that they can be combined to yield superior performance.

Overall, hbB performs comparably to hdD. However, note that some domains were improved by Type-based but not by IP (e.g. \pddl{nomystery, sokoban, childsnack})
or vise versa (\pddl{transport, visitall}).
% 
% For example, with $\cg$, (hb) outperforms (hd) on \pddl{parking14} and \pddl{tetris14}, while
% \pddl{openstacks14} and \pddl{childsnack14} are solved only by (hd) and other configurations have 0 coverage.
% Similarly with $\ff$, while (hb) improves performance on \pddl{visitall11} ($3.0\rightarrow 5.3$), (hd) does not, and
%  and vice versa on \pddl{childsnack14} ($0.0\rightarrow 4.0$ by (hd)).
% 
These results indicate that Type-based and IP diversification are orthogonal,
addressing different diversity criteria (depth vs breadth).
