From these results, 

One of the key observation proved in thi paper is that
\textbf{optimising search can be seen as a series of satisficing search
in various $f$-plateau}. 

This concept is familiar in
SAT/IP/CP model-based sequential planning solvers where a planning
problem is converted to a correspoinding constraint satisfaction problem
with a finite horizon $t$.

Although we evaluated only one satisficing configuration $\ffo$ in a
plateau region, it does not preclude the possibility of applying yet
more variety of satisficing planning techniques, such as lazy-evaluation
or preferred operators in LAMA, depth-first probe in Probe, or
random-walk strategy in Arvand, or Type-based exploration in Type-GBFS.
