% DBFS \cite{imai2011novel} is also an algorithm which diversifies the
% search based on $g$ and $h$ values, but with several key differences from
% above two algorithms: First, the explorative selection is not uniformly
% random, but is subject to a particular distribution function defined by
% $h, g, h_{min}$ and $g_{max}$. Second, it uses a local search with
% a bounded number of expansions equal to $h(s)$, which dynamically balances the exploration
% and exploitation --- it does more GBFS when $h$ is large (far
% from the goal), and less GBFS near the goal ($h$ is small).
