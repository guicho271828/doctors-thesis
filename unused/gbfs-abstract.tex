We also apply the same strategy to GBFS for satisficing search, where
 currently no obvious tiebreaking rules are proposed. Our depth
 diviersification resulted in an orthogonal improvement to the other
 search enhancements such as Lazy Evaluation, Preferred Operators,
 Multi-heuristic search, and recently proposed Type-Based
 diversification tequeniques.

Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis on why the depth-based
diversification improves the performance of several algorithms. By doing
this, it ensure the same technique can applied to various best first
search algorithms that are not investigated in this paper such as
Weighted A*.
