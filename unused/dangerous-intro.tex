Since the beginning of AI research, the study on one of its core
component, graph search, has long focused on how to guide it using the
heuristic estimate and how to improve the estimates.  One thing that has
been out of focus is the study on tiebreaking, or how to \emph{directly}
improve the search performance on a plateau without changing the
heuristics nor search algorithms.  Such techniques should be done
without help of additional information from the heuristics because
theoretically there is some point that the heuristics cannot be improved
any more while the plateau is still exponentially large.
