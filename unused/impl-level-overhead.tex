% This comparison below may be useful in a future version of the paper, but not necessary in this version.
%% First, we compared $[h,\ld,\lifo]$ and $[h,\fd,\fifo]$
%% with $[f,h,\lifo]$ and $[f,h,\fifo]$, respectively, in order to see
%% the extra cost of managing the depth-based buckets.
%% The node evaluation order of $[h,\fd,\fifo]$ and $[h,\ld,\lifo]$
%% are exactly the same as $[f,h,\fifo]$ and $[f,h,\lifo]$.
%% This is because:
%% (1) $[f,h,\lifo]$ expands the most recently evaluated/inserted
%% states, and (2) the depth increases monotonically within the same $[f,h]$,
%% thus (3) $[f,h,\lifo]$ always expands the largest depth. (Similar logic
%% applies to $[f,h,\fifo]$.)
%% % 
%% % yet these results are useful in assessing the extra cost of managing the
%% % depth-based buckets.
%% As expected, the performances of $[h,\ld,\lifo]$ and
%% $[h,\fd,\fifo]$ are slightly worse than $[f,h,\lifo]$ and
%% $[f,h,\fifo]$, respectively, due to the cost of managing the depth-based buckets.



%% \todo{move this to the final section after reviewing the action ordering}
%% % removed \fifo
%% Finally, we answer two following concerns regarding \lifo final-level
%% tiebreaking criteria which appear in $[f,h,\lifo]$ and
%% $[f,h,\ld,\lifo]$. The evaluation in the earlier sections contains
%% two open questions: (1) Do the action orderings affect the performance of \lifo? 
%% (2) Doesn't \lifo benefit from its efficient low-level memory access pattern (high
%% probability of hitting the cache), not by the search efficiency?
%% They are both rejected because the
%% coverage of $[f,h,\ld,\lifo]=[f,h,\lifo]$ is not significantly
%% different from $[f,h,\ld,\ro]$, i.e.,
%% $859,857 \in [863.5-8.9,863.5+8.9]$,
%% despite the difference in the third-level tiebreaking (\lifo vs \ro).
%% % 
%% It means that the
%% performance of $[f,h,\lifo]$($=[f,h,\ld,\lifo]$) was not caused by the final-level
%% \lifo, but instead by the implicit second-level tiebreaking LastDepth.
%% %% remove
%% % Besides, this problem is not important now that RandomDepth
%% % is outperforming LastDepth-based tiebreaking strategy.
%% % 
%% With the similar logic, we can claim that the bad performance of
%% $[f,h,\fd,\fifo]$ and $[f,h,\fifo]$ can be attributed to its the
%% inherent second-level FirstDepth, and not to the third-level \fifo.
%% %% Unfortunately, 829,828 is not \in 816.7 +- 2.2.
%% %% this can be changed if we rerun _random with O(1) random deletion.
