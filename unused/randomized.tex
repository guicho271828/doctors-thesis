% In many domains,
% the performance was significantly affected by 2nd-level tiebreaking, and
% $[f,h,\rd,\ro]$ dominated the others. 
% Although $[f,h, \ld, \ro]$ and $[f,h,\rd,\ro]$ performed similarly on most domains, 
% the performance of $[f,h,\rd,\ro]$ in some
% domains are notable (e.g., \pddl{Cybersec}, \pddl{Woodworking-cut}). 
% The standard deviation of $[f,h,\rd,\ro]$ coverage tends to be smaller
% than that of $[f,h,\ld,\ro]$, indicating that $[f,h,\rd,\ro]$ is robust with respect to random seeds.
% $[f,h,\fd,\ro]$ is mostly dominated by $[f,h,\rd,\ro]$ and $[f,h,\ld,\ro]$,

% We no longer need the ``depth as explanation of LIFO/FIFO'' story, because  the ``random is good'' depth-based methods [f,h,rd,ro]  story is simpler.
