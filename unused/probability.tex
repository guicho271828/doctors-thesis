% % First, at the end of $D$'th iteration,
% % expansion has happened $D(D-1)$ times in total, and depth $d$ is expanded $D-d$ times.
% % Thus, first, the probability of selecting a depth $d$ for expansion is simply $\frac{D-d}{D(D-1)}$.
% We should obtain the probability of selecting a node $n$ in a bucket with depth $d$
% in the course of $D$ iterations (i.e. $D(D-1)$ expansions in total and $D-d$ expansions in depth $d$).
% At this point, the number of nodes generated in this bucket is $N$.
% There are $\frac{N!}{(N-(D-d))!}$ potential ways to select $D-d$ nodes in this bucket.
% Among these, 
% there are $\frac{(N-1)!}{((N-1)-(D-d))!}$ ways to select $D-d$ nodes from the nodes \emph{except} $n$.
% Assuming the randomized default tiebreaking \ro, the probability of selecting $n$ in $D-d$ expansions is therefore
% \[
%  1-\frac{(N-1)!}{((N-1)-(D-d))!} \cdot \frac{(N-(D-d))!}{N!} = 1- \frac{N-(D-d)}{N} = \frac{D-d}{N}
% \]
% 
% \[
%  \frac{D-d}{N} = \frac{D-d}{w(D-d+1)} = \frac{1}{w}(1+\frac{1}{d-(D+1)})
% \]
% 
% below is wrong, since it does not account for the fact that there are D-d expansions
% Next, after selecting this depth bucket, the probability of selecting a node in the bucket is $\frac{1}{w(D-d+1)}$ because
% the depth $d-1$ is expanded $D-(d-1)$ times in the preceding $D$ iterations
% and therefore, the total number of nodes that have been in depth $d$, including those that have been expanded so far, is $w(D-d+1)$.
% 
% 
% Thus, the probability of expanding each node in depth $d$ is
% $\frac{D-d}{D(D-1)\cdot w(D-d+1)}=\frac{1}{wD(D-1)}(1-\frac{1}{D-d+1})$. 
% 
% \qed
% 
% Notice that $\frac{1}{d-(D+1)}$ is a negligible amount of negative value if $d \ll D$.
% Thus, after enough number of iterations (large $D$), the nodes are 
% expanded in an approximately equal probability $\frac{1}{w}$ in the shallower region and is
% unaffected by the depth of the node.
% % However, the nodes near the largest depth have less probability, showing
% % some balance in exploration and exploitation.
% % Also, the difference of $\frac{1}{d-(D+1)}$ wrto $D$ is small ($O((D-d)^2)$) compared to 1
