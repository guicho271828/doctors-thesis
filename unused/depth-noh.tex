\subsection{Depth-Based Tiebreaking Without Considering $h$}

\label{sec:depth-noh}

In \refsec{sec:noh}, we showed that $[f,\lifo]$ tiebreaking
(without considering $h$) is sufficient for the standard IPC benchmarks
-- the performance of $[f,\lifo]$, $[f,h,\lifo]$, and $[f,h,\fifo]$ are
comparable.  In order to see if it also holds for depth-based
tiebreaking, we evaluated the performance of $[f,\depth,\fifo]$
and $[f,\depth,\lifo]$.
\reftbl{tbl:lmcut-zero-noh} and \reftbl{tbl:mands-zero-noh}
 shows that
 $[f,h,\depth,\fifo]$ and  $[f,h,\depth,\lifo]$
 perform comparably to $[f,h,\fifo]$ and $[f,h,\lifo]$.

% Although $[\rd,\ro]$ behaves in a less greedy/depth-first manner than $[f,\lifo]$, 
% it explores nodes with high depth sufficiently often so that even if \lifo behavior (seeking nodes that are far from the plateau entrance) is required, $[\rd,\ro]$ will eventually find the solution.
% Moreover, there are some domains (\pddl{pipesworld-pushend} and \pddl{woodworking-opt11}) where a the more randomized behavior of $[\rd,\ro]$ is advantageous.
% Thus, overall, $[\rd,\ro]$ performs moderately well, and 
% \emph{neither $h$ nor \lifo-behavior is necessary in order to obtain performance that is competitive with the standard
% tiebreaking strategies}.
