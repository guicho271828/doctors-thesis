In this paper, we investigate and improve tiebreaking strategies for
 cost-optimal search using A*.
 We first experimentally analyze the performance of common tiebreaking
 strategies that break ties according to the heuristic value of the
 nodes.  We find that tiebreaking strategy has a significant impact on search
 algorithm performance when there are zero-cost operators that induce
 large plateau regions in the search space. With this in mind, we
 develop two new kinds of tiebreaking strategy.
 The first one is based on a depth metric which
 measures the distance from the entrance to the plateau and proposes a
 new, diversifying strategy which significantly outperforms standard
 strategies on domains with zero-cost actions.
 We give both a theoretical analysis and an empirical analysis
 supporting this.
 Another one is an admissible multi-heuristic tiebreaking strategy
 based on the inadmissible distance-to-go variations of various heuristics.
 It is shown to further improve the performance
 in combination with the depth metric.
 Finally, we open a new interpretation to the optimal search by 
 pointing out that the multi-heuristic strategy is a rare attempt to apply a satisficing
 technique to optimal search.
 This new interpretation is additionally supported by
 the empirical results of the satisficing search using GBFS
 enhanced by the depth diversification.
