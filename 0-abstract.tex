In this paper, we investigate and improve tiebreaking strategies for
 cost-optimal search using A*.
 We first experimentally analyze the performance of common tiebreaking
 strategies that break ties according to the heuristic value of the
 nodes.  We find that tiebreaking strategy has a significant impact on search
 algorithm performance when there are 0-cost operators that induce
 large plateau regions in the search space. With this in mind, we
 develop two new classes of tiebreaking strategy.
 The first class of strategy we propose is based on a depth metric which
 measures the distance from the entrance to the plateau. We  proposes a
 new, depth diversification strategy which significantly outperforms standard
 strategies on domains with 0-cost actions.
 We provide both a theoretical analysis and an empirical analysis
 supporting these results.
 We propose a new framework for interpreting \astar search as a series of satisficing searches within plateaus consisting of nodes with the same f-cost.
 Based on this framework, we investigate a second class of tiebreaking strategy 
 which is a  multi-heuristic tiebreaking strategy
 which embeds inadmissible, distance-to-go variations of various heuristics within an admissible search.
 This is shown to further improve the performance
 in combination with the depth metric.
