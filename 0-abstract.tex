In this paper, we investigate and improve tiebreaking strategies for
 optimising search using A*.
 We first experimentally analyze the performance of common tiebreaking
 strategies that break ties according to the heuristic value of the
 nodes.  We find that tiebreaking has a significant impact on search
 algorithm performance when there are zero-cost operators that induce
 large plateau regions in the search space. With this in mind, we
 develop a new kind of tiebreaking based on a depth metric which
 measures the distance from the entrance to the plateau, and propose a
 new, diversifying strategy which significantly outperforms standard
 strategies on domains with zero-cost actions.

This paper is a significantly extended version of the AAAI-16 paper by
the same authors.
