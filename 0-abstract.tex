In this paper, we investigate and improve tie-breaking strategies for
 cost-optimal search using A*.
 We first experimentally analyze the performance of common tie-breaking
 strategies that break ties according to the heuristic value of the
 nodes.  We find that tie-breaking strategy has a significant impact on search
 algorithm performance when there are 0-cost operators that induce
 large plateau regions in the search space. With this in mind, we
 develop two new classes of tie-breaking strategy.
 The first class of strategy we propose is based on a depth metric which
 measures the distance from the entrance to the plateau. We  proposes a
 new, depth diversification strategy which significantly outperforms standard
 strategies on domains with 0-cost actions.
 We provide both a theoretical analysis and an empirical analysis
 supporting these results.
 Next, we propose a new framework for interpreting \astar search as a series of satisficing searches within plateaus consisting of nodes with the same f-cost.
 Based on this framework, we investigate a second class of tie-breaking strategy 
 which is a  multi-heuristic tie-breaking strategy
 which embeds inadmissible, distance-to-go variations of various heuristics within an admissible search.
 This is shown to further improve the performance
 in combination with the depth metric.
